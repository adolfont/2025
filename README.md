Although functional programming languages are not yet as popular as object-oriented ones, their growing relevance in the industry has become increasingly evident in recent years. However, the application of software engineering techniques to systems built with these languages remains underexplored in academia, leaving many open questions to be investigated.

In this context, the 1st Workshop on Software Engineering for Functional Programming (SE4FP 2025) represents an excellent opportunity to bridge this gap. The event aims to create a space where members of academia and industry can share and discuss experiences, best practices, tools, and research related to applying software engineering principles to systems developed with functional programming languages. In addition to fostering relevant discussions, the workshop seeks to serve as a bridge for establishing collaborations between research groups and between academia and industry, opening up new opportunities for investigation.

In 2025, SE4FP is co-located with the 16th Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice ([CBSoft 2025](https://cbsoft.sbc.org.br/2025/cbsoft/)).
